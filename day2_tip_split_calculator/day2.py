# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# Example Input
# Welcome to the tip calculator!
# What was the total bill?
# How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?
# How many people to split the bill?
